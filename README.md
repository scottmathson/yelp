# Scott Mathson's Yelp prototype repo

## v. 1 - "The Anti-Fold" (why: users will scroll)

Static prototype focused on above the fold content, with intent/main CTA being "Review". Simplification of navigation, alongside big, bold hero space, and a clear intent.

Actions of both buttons essentially lead toward same goal - user submissions, reviews.
